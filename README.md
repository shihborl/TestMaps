# TestMaps
Basic Google Maps application that places a marker where you search for

The application starts by pinning to the location you asked for, 
@40.6609917,-73.9827139
and zooms in at a level of 15 to give you a nice readable view of the area. 

The search bar above is a google search bar, so you can only type in places that
are on google and is a way to verify addresses. 
Once you select your address, the application will change view to the new address,
and give you the same zoom 15 view of that area around the pin.
